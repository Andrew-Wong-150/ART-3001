      Back at the Shoe. Home of many good memories. Truth be told I was never a
      huge fan of football but I loved the crowds. It was always something to look
      forward to. I will miss being a part of the student section, chanting with
      the masses. Hopefully I can go to grad school and be part of it for just a
      bit longer, although I doubt it will be nearly as much fun as most of my
      friends are graduating...
