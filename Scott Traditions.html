      Another busy day at Scott Traditions. Lots of people as always. The chorus
      of plates and people is a familiar noise. Whether it's a quick bite before class
      or a group dinner with my friends, Scott Traditions was the go-to place. I remember
      my friends and I knew the schedule down to a science. They served fried chicken wings
      after 7 in the evening and the asian grill wasn't too busy around 2:30. Many post-exam
      ice cream bowls have been had here. (Also I thought the food was good, besides the
      undercooked pink chicken).
